# First repository
#### Andrew Carnegie:
> Think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success. A whole, clear, glorious year lies before you.

## Purpose
This repository is to be used as a *pool* of various learning materials. As a matter of fact, I write this **README** file just bacause I want to learn how to use *Markdown*...So boring, right?

## Someting else...
My first document is [GITHUB USAGE](https://github.com/jwtty/firsttry/blob/master/git.md), which is a succinct instruction on how to use git and github.
Later on, I will add more materials.

LaLaLa~
